# SQL-Project---Sales-Database-Project
The Sales Database Project showcases fundamental SQL skills by creating a comprehensive sales database. It involves creating tables, inserting data, and executing various SQL queries to analyze and manipulate the sales data.


Database Creation: A database named sales_database is created with a table SalesData that includes fields for customer information, product details, sales amount, region, and feedback.

Data Insertion: Multiple records are inserted into the SalesData table to simulate sales transactions.

Queries:

Basic Retrieval: Simple SELECT statements to retrieve all data or specific columns like Gender.

Filtering: Queries to filter records based on conditions such as Gender = 'Female' or SalesAmount between specific values.

Aggregation: Calculations such as average (AVG) and sum (SUM) of SalesAmount, grouped by Region and filtered by conditions.

Ordering: Sorting data by SalesAmount in descending order.

Subqueries: Using subqueries to filter records based on the average sales amount.

Data Manipulation: Deleting records and counting the total number of records.

This project demonstrates the ability to handle various SQL operations, providing a solid foundation for more complex database management and data analysis tasks.
